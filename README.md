# Distributed lock manager

Great! Implementing a distributed lock with ZooKeeper involves using **ephemeral sequential ZNodes** to ensure **fairness** and **automatic release on failure**. Here's how we'll approach it:

---

### **1️⃣ Set Up ZooKeeper Environment**
- Ensure a ZooKeeper ensemble is running.
- Connect to ZooKeeper using the CLI or a Node.js client.

---

### **2️⃣ Design Lock Acquisition and Release Mechanisms**
- **Lock acquisition**: Create an **ephemeral sequential ZNode** (e.g., `/locks/lock_00000001`).
- **Lock granting**: The process that creates the **smallest sequential ZNode** gets the lock.
- **Lock release**: The lock holder deletes its ZNode after completing its task.

---

### **3️⃣ Implement Exclusive and Shared Locking**
- **Exclusive lock**: Only one process can hold the lock.
- **Shared lock**: Multiple processes can read concurrently, but only one can write.

---

### **4️⃣ Add Timeout Functionality**
- If a process doesn't acquire the lock within a timeout period, it **fails gracefully**.
- Can be done using **watches** and **expiration checks**.

---

### **5️⃣ Test Lock Contention Scenarios**
- Simulate **multiple clients competing** for the lock.
- Test **failure scenarios** (e.g., leader node crashes).
- Verify **correct order of lock acquisition**.
